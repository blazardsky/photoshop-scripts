**BASIC INFORMATIONS:**

**PS Layers Unique Name & Batch Export**

This script only needs a little setup before you can use it: create a group, name it *export* and add all the layers you want to export inside it. The script will then rename all those layers with a unique sequential name an export them inside a folder with the same name of the psd file, in the same directory of the psd file.
